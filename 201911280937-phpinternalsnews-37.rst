In this episode of "PHP Internals News" we are celebrating the new features
that are part of this release. Instead of talking with a single guest about an
RFC or feature, instead, I have asked followers of the `@PHPIntNews
<https://twitter.com/PHPIntNews>`_ Twitter account to record a snippet to talk
about their own favourite PHP 7.4 features.

With thanks to *Benjamin Eberlei*, *George Banyard*, *James Titcumb*, *Mark
Randall*, *Matthew Setter*, *Nikita Popov*, *Vincent Dechenaux*, and *William
Pinaud*.
