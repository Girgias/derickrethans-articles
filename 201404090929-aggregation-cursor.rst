Now that MongoDB 2.6 has been released, the PHP driver for MongoDB has also
received amny updates to support the new features. In this series of articles,
I will illustrate some of those updates.

In this article, I will introduce command cursors and demonstrate how they
can be applied to aggregations. I previously wrote about the
`Aggregation Framework`_ last year, but since then it has received a lot of
updates and improvements. One of those improvements relates to how the
Aggregation Framework (A/F) returns results. Before MongoDB 2.6, the A/F
could only return *one* document, with all the results stored under the
``results`` key::

     <?php
     $m = new MongoClient;
     $c = $m->demo->cities;

     $pipeline = [
          [ '$group' => [
               '_id' => '$country_code',
               'timezones' => [ '$addToSet' => '$timezone' ]
          ] ],
          [ '$sort' => [ '_id' => 1 ] ],
     ];

     $r = $c->aggregate( $pipeline );
     var_dump( $r['result'] );
     ?>

This code would output something like::

     array(242) {
       [0] =>
       array(2) {
          '_id' => string(2) "AD"
          'timezones' => array(1) { [0] => string(14) "Europe/Andorra" }
       }
       [1] =>
       array(2) {
          '_id' => string(2) "AE"
          'timezones' => array(1) { [0] => string(10) "Asia/Dubai" }
       }
       [2] =>
       array(2) {
          '_id' => string(2) "AF"
          'timezones' => array(1) { [0] => string(10) "Asia/Kabul" }
       }
       â€¦

`MongoCollection::aggregate()`_ is implemented under the hood as a database
command. The method in the PHP driver merely wraps this, but you can also
call A/F through the `MongoDB::command()`_ method::

     <?php
     $m = new MongoClient;
     $d = $m->demo;

     $pipeline = [
          [ '$group' => [
               '_id' => '$country_code',
               'timezones' => [ '$addToSet' => '$timezone' ]
          ] ],
          [ '$sort' => [ '_id' => 1 ] ],
     ];

     $r = $d->command( [
          'aggregate' => 'cities',
          'pipeline' => $pipeline,
     ] );
     var_dump( $r['result'] );
     ?>

Because a database command only returns *one* document, the result is limited
to a maximum of 16MB. This is not a problem for my example, but it can
can certainly be a limiting factor for other A/F queries.

MongoDB 2.6 adds support for returning a cursor for an aggregation command.
With the raw command interface, you simply add the extra ``cursor`` element::

     $r = $d->command( [
          'aggregate' => 'cities',
          'pipeline' => $pipeline,
          'cursor' => [ 'batchSize' => 1 ],
     ] );
     var_dump( $r );

Instead of a document with all results inline, you get a cursor definition back::

     array(2) {
       'cursor' =>
       array(3) {
          'id' => class MongoInt64#5 (1) {
               public $value => string(12) "392201189815" 
          }
          'ns' => string(11) "demo.cities"
          'firstBatch' => array(1) {
            [0] =>
            array(2) {
               '_id' => string(2) "AD"
               'timezones' => array(1) { [0] => string(14) "Europe/Andorra" }
            }
          }
       }
       'ok' => double(1)
     }

The cursor definition contains the cursor ID (in ``id``), the namespace
(``ns``), and whether the command succeeded (in ``ok``).
The definition also a portion of the results. The number of items in
``firstBatch`` is configured by the value given to ``batchSize`` in the
command.

To create a cursor that you can iterate over in PHP, you need to convert this
cursor definition to a `MongoCommandCursor`_ object. You can do that with the
`MongoCommandCursor::createFromDocument()`_ factory method. This factory
method takes three arguments: the ``MongoClient`` object (``$m`` in my
example), the *connection hash*, and the cursor definition that was returned.
The hash is required so that we can fetch new results from the same
connection that executed the original command.

To obtain the connection hash, we need to include a by-ref variable as the
third argument to ``MongoCollection::command()``::

     <?php
     $m = new MongoClient;
     $d = $m->demo;

     $pipeline = [
          [ '$group' => [
               '_id' => '$country_code',
               'timezones' => [ '$addToSet' => '$timezone' ]
          ] ],
          [ '$sort' => [ '_id' => 1 ] ],
     ];

     $r = $d->command(
          [
               'aggregate' => 'cities',
               'pipeline' => $pipeline,
               'cursor' => [ 'batchSize' => 1 ],
          ],
          null,
          $hash
     );
     var_dump( $hash );

The hash looks like ``localhost:27017;-;.;26415``. Together with the result,
you can now construct a ``MongoCommandCursor``::

     $cursor = MongoCommandCursor::createFromDocument( $m, $hash, $r );

And iterate over it::

     foreach ( $cursor as $result )
     {
          echo $result['_id'], ': ', join( ', ', $result['timezones'] ), "\n";
     }
     ?>

As this is all a bit cumbersome, we have also added a helper method for this:
`MongoCollection::aggregateCursor`_. This internally does the whole
MongoCommandCursor_ creation dance, and simplifies the previous example to::

     <?php
     $m = new MongoClient;
     $c = $m->demo->cities;

     $pipeline = [
          [ '$group' => [
               '_id' => '$country_code',
               'timezones' => [ '$addToSet' => '$timezone' ]
          ] ],
          [ '$sort' => [ '_id' => 1 ] ],
     ];

     $r = $c->aggregateCursor( $pipeline );

     foreach ( $r as $result )
     {
          echo $result['_id'], ': ', join( ', ', $result['timezones'] ), "\n";
     }
     ?>

This helper also automatically sets the initial batch size to 101. You can
change the batchSize for subsequent batches by using the
`MongoCommandCursor::batchSize()`_ method, and for the initial batch by
specifying an option to ``MongoCollection::aggregateCursor``::

     $options = [ 'cursor' => [ 'batchSize' => 5 ] ];

     $r = $d->cities->aggregateCursor( $pipeline, $options );
     $r->batchSize( 25 );

In general, you probably should not change the default batch sizes.

The Aggregation Framework has some other new features in MongoDB 2.6 as well.
Please refer to the `release notes`_ for more information. I might write
another post on some of those features later, too.
