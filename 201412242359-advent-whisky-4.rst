This is another bottle that I got given as a gift for Xdebug_. It is a 21 year
old whisky from the GlenDronach_ distillery. This `GlenDronach Parliament`_
has been matured in a combination of Oloroso *and* Pedro Ximinez sherry casks.
It is a bit stronger at 48% ABV. 

*Tasting notes*: Very dark colour. Also very sweet, a tad spicy and hints of
plums and other fruits. The sherry flavours are have a big overtone, but don't 
over power. The whisky ends with an oaky finish. A drop of water doesn't
really help.
