This is another bottle that I got given as a gift for Xdebug_. It is a 21 year
old whisky from the GlenDronach_ distillery. This `GlenDronach Parliament`_
has been matured in a combination of Oloroso *and* Pedro Ximinez sherry casks.
It is a bit stronger at 48% ABV. 

*Tasting notes*: Very dark colour. Also very sweet, a tad spicy and hints of
plums and other fruits. The sherry flavours are have a big overtone, but don't 
over power. The whisky ends with an oaky finish. A drop of water doesn't
really help.

Tonight we have a `Springbank 15`_, bought as a set of minatures from
`Cadenhead's`_ to give away as wedding favours. As it is exactly six months
ago since we got married, that seemed to be a fitting whisky to include. It is
a Campbeltown whisky and not *particularly* special, but it reminds me of good
times past. It was of course also quite nice of Cadenhead's to provide the
minatures with a label with our names on it!. And, we did try out which whisky
to pick as favours. We've tried a `Springbank 10`_, 12_ and 15_, but the 15
year old won. Although I think we liked the 10 over the 12.

*Tasting notes*: Caramel, Vanilla, malty with some smokyness. Lingers long on
the tongue with hints of pepper, and a flavour that sits all over the tongue.
Well balanced.

---------------------------------------------

Another unusual whisky. Tonight's `Cradle Mountain 15`_ is distilled by 
`Small Concern Whisky Distillery`_, a distillery in Tasmania. It is bottled by 
Cadenhead_ at 57.9% ABV as part of their World Whiskies series. It has been
aged for 15 years in ex. Jim Beam Bourbon Barrels. It is one of 186 bottles,
and as you would expect with a single cask whisky, it does not have colouring
added, or has it been chill-filtered.

*Tasting notes*: Very much in your face. It's sweet and syrup, but also oaky.
The bourbon certainly has made its impression on this one. I would almost go
as far as saying that it  has more of a liqueur flavour to it than a "normal"
whisky. It gets better with a drop of water, and the finish is long lingering
with tropical fruits.

-------------------------------------------------

A bottle that I got as a birthday gift, which is fitting as today is my
birthday! This whisky is certified organic and a blend of 7 casks. Each batch
is a unique expression. This is `batch 003`_ of this `Highland Harvest`_
whisky. It is bottled at 40% ABV.

*Tasting notes*: The colour is very pale. It's quite light, a little smoky and
a taste of oak is very apparent. It's quite sharp, but also watery. The after
taste is not very long, but what there is, is oak. I think this whisky should
be aged more, as there is unfortunately very little character to it.

*Morag says*: It smells like blue cheese, and it would probably work great as
a cocktail whisky.

December 23nd: The English Whisky 2010 - Chapter 9
--------------------------------------------------

Tonight's whisky is a dram from `The English Whisky Company`_. Yes, a
distillery from England. This `Chapter 9`_ is the first ever English peated
whisky, bottled at 46% ABV and is mixed from four casks. The distillery
started distilling in 2006, and is therefore very young. The English Whisky
Co. source their barley, yeast and water from within England, making this a
truly English spirit. It is also a very young whisky, at only 3 years old. It
is non-chill filtered, and it does not have colour added.

*Tasting notes*: Peated, light smoke. A bit watery on the palette, with not
much of an after taste. You can easily taste that it is a very young whisky as
it's rather sharp, but there are hints of citrus and pepper.

December 24nd: Glenmorangie Quarter Century
-------------------------------------------

This is the most expensive whisky in my collection, but I don't think it is
the best one. Some of the whiskies from Cadenhead's that I featured in earlier
days in this advent calendar are several leagues ahead. Nonetheless, I am
quite happy having a bottle of this `Glenmorangie Quarter Century`_. It comes
in a nice box too. I like this whisky even better, as it was another gift due
to my work on Xdebug_.

*Tasting notes*: It is a very rounded whisky, floral hints and citrus. The
flavours are quite a mouth full and a lot is going on. There is also a toasty
sweetness. It lingers a little while with a oaky after taste. A very enjoyable
dram.
