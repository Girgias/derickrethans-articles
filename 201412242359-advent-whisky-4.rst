This is another bottle that I got given as a gift for Xdebug_. It is a 21 year
old whisky from the GlenDronach_ distillery. This `GlenDronach Parliament`_
has been matured in a combination of Oloroso *and* Pedro Ximinez sherry casks.
It is a bit stronger at 48% ABV. 

*Tasting notes*: Very dark colour. Also very sweet, a tad spicy and hints of
plums and other fruits. The sherry flavours are have a big overtone, but don't 
over power. The whisky ends with an oaky finish. A drop of water doesn't
really help.

Tonight we have a `Springbank 15`_, bought as a set of minatures from
`Cadenhead's`_ to give away as wedding favours. As it is exactly six months
ago since we got married, that seemed to be a fitting whisky to include. It is
a Campbeltown whisky and not *particularly* special, but it reminds me of good
times past. It was of course also quite nice of Cadenhead's to provide the
minatures with a label with our names on it!. And, we did try out which whisky
to pick as favours. We've tried a `Springbank 10`_, 12_ and 15_, but the 15
year old won. Although I think we liked the 10 over the 12.

*Tasting notes*: Caramel, Vanilla, malty with some smokyness. Lingers long on
the tongue with hints of pepper, and a flavour that sits all over the tongue.
Well balanced.
