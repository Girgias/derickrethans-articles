Two years ago Morag and I went on a whisky tasting tour with `Rabbie's`_ to
visit a few of `Speyside's distilleries`_. Now, this August we left the smooth
and sweeter whiskies a side, and instead we headed over to Islay. Again with
`Rabbie's`_.

Our train up to Edinburgh was nothing special, except that Eastcoast has now
been replaced with `Virgin Trains East Coast`_. No real changes, except for
the name. This time however, we got into Edinburgh just as the Fringe_ was
starting. And that made *staying* in Edinburgh quite a bit more expensive. We
thought to be clever and book a hotel near Rabbie's pick-up point, but I had
failed to realize that they actually moved itâ€”right next to the hotel we
stayed in last time.

The afternoon before the tour started, we had some free time in Edinburgh. We
promptly headed to `BrewDog's`_ pub to have a beer and play some
connect-four, before we headed to `The Edinburgh Larder`_ for a nice meal. On
the way back, we caught the last Sun rays hitting `Edinburgh Castle`_.
