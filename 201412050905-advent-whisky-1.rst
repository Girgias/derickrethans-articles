The first whisky on the calendar is a 9 year old Glenrothes_, bottled by
Douglas_. It is one out of 210 bottles of a single cask (#9928) distilled in
2004 and bottled in 2013, aged in a Sherry Butt.

*Tasting notes*: Oily on the tongue. Sherry flavours with a hint of fruits. Smokey
after taste.

*About Glenrothes:* "Established by the burn of Rothes in Speyside in 1879, The
Glenrothes distillery has been producing its characteristic Speyside single
Malt for over 130 years. The maturity of The Glenrothes is determined not by
age, but by Vintage, resulting in some memorable moments, captured forever in
specific expressions of this remarkable spirit."

Tonight's dram is a GlenGrant_ `170th anniversary`_, bottled to commemorate
the 170th anniversary of the Glen Grant distillery. Now owned by the Italian
Gruppo Campari, the distillery was founded in 1840. It is a non-chill filtered
whisky at 46% ABV.

*Tasting notes*: Sweet, raisins and rich fruits. Long finish with hints of peat
smoke. Actually, very long finish, perhaps like a sherry.

Tonight we have a dram from Benromach_, a distillery that I actually visted
last year as part of our big `whisky trip`_ last year. Its `2001 cask
strength`_ whisky is matured in first fill Bourbon barrels, and *no longer
available*. At 59.9% ABV it is stronger and benefits from a drop of water.

*Tasting notes*: Honey, sweet, and vanilla. I also taste some nuts, and a
little bit of peat. Quite a nice dram, but does definitely need a drop or two
of water.
