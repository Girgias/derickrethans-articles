The first whisky on the calendar is a 9 year old Glenrothes_, bottled by
Douglas_. It is one out of 210 bottles of a single cask (#9928) distilled in
2004 and bottled in 2013, aged in a Sherry Butt.

*Flavours:* Oily on the tongue. Sherry flavours with a hint of fruits. Smokey
after taste.

*About Glenrothes:* "Established by the burn of Rothes in Speyside in 1879, The
Glenrothes distillery has been producing its characteristic Speyside single
Malt for over 130 years. The maturity of The Glenrothes is determined not by
age, but by Vintage, resulting in some memorable moments, captured forever in
specific expressions of this remarkable spirit."
