Tonight's dram is an `Auchentoshan American Oak`_. It's from a bottle that I
received as a gift for speaking at `Glasgow PHP_`. Thanks! This Auchentoshan_
does not have an age statement, giving the bottlers a bit more freedom in
which ages of barrels they use to blend with. It is possible that whiskies as
young as three years are part of this "blend". This specific whisky is aged in
first-fill Bourbon casks. Unlike many other whiskies on this calendar, it is
both chill filtered and coloured. 

*Tasting notes*: Over ripe fruits, oak, and a sour grapefruit finish. It's a
little bland, but still quite enjoyable.
