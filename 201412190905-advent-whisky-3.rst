December 12th: Auchentoshan American Oak
----------------------------------------

Tonight's dram is an `Auchentoshan American Oak`_. It's from a bottle that I
received as a gift for speaking at `Glasgow PHP`_. Thanks! This Auchentoshan_
does not have an age statement, giving the bottlers a bit more freedom in
which ages of barrels they use to blend with. It is possible that whiskies as
young as three years are part of this "blend". This specific whisky is aged in
first-fill Bourbon casks. Unlike many other whiskies on this calendar, it is
both chill filtered and coloured. 

*Tasting notes*: Over ripe fruits, oak, and a sour grapefruit finish. It's a
little bland, and it has a short finish. It's still quite enjoyable.

*Morag says*: Slightly sharp nose, a little bit like vanilla. Not the
smoothest with a hint of roughness. Short finish. Tastes like cardboard (or
woody). Does not compare well to the `Three Wood`_.

December 13th: Cadenhead's Glen Moray 21 year old
-------------------------------------------------

Another dram from Cadenhead's. It is a 21 year old whisky, distilled in 1992.
It is part of their Wine Cask range and as usual, it is non-chill filtered and
no colouring has been added. The `1992 CA`_ is bottled at 55.4% ABV cask
strength. A little curious is that the distillery on the label is `Glen
Moray-Glenlivet`_ — the "Glenlivet" addition is not often seen anymore. There
were only 216, and I'm afraid they are all sold out.

*Tasting notes*: It does need a drop of water to bring out some flavours—at
55.4% it is just a little bit too strong. Hints of sweeter wine, and cake. 
Perhaps a hint of aniseed and a finish of medicinal herbs. I'm not quite sure
what to make of it really.

I recently found the Whiskybase_ online, and noticed its extensive list of
available whiskies. However, the whisky I had tonight was not known to them
yet. I have since then added it.

The whisky is a `22 year old`_, single cask, cask strength whisky bottled by
`Speciality Drinks`_ . This casks rendered 250 bottles and at 54.1% ABV it is
a bit on the stronger side, and needs a little bit of water. I bought it at
the `Whisky Exchange`_ as the bottle of the month[#]_ for July. Interestingly
the label on my bottle is different than what they have on their site.

*Tasting notes*: It is a very clear whisky. I taste hints of apple and cream.
And with more than a hint of toffee. It lingers quite long with a hint of more
toffee.

December 15th: Mortlach Càrn Mòr Strictly Limited
-------------------------------------------------

Tonight's dram is a whisky from the Mortlach_ distillery. Another whisky that
the Whiskybase_ did not have! Or rather, I thought so. The search engine
insisted that I spelled it "`Mortlach Càrn Mòr`_" and wouldn't find it if I used
"Carn Mor" :-/ 

This whisky is not from a single cask, but rather from two casks yielding 652
bottles. The whisky is non-chill filtered and has no colouring added. It is
bottled at 46% ABV by `Morrison and MacKay`_ for their Strictly Limited range.
The "two" whiskies are at least 16 years old and aged in Hogshead_ casks.

*Tasting notes*: Smooth and creamy honey on the tongue. Light summer fruits
and caramel after taste. Could do with a few drops of water to make the
flavours come out more.

The first non Scottish whisky in this calendar. Tonight we have a Dutch
whisky, distilled in 1999 by `Zuidam Distillery`_, and bottled by `Milroy's of
Soho`_ in 2013. This `Millstone 1999`_ is one of 271 bottles of a 14 year old
single cask whisky matured in Sherry Casks. It is 46% ABV and again, non-chill
filtered and it does not have colouring added. The whisky itself is quite dark
of colour, rather like a sherry.

*Tasting notes*: Raisins, cinnamon, and a sweet sherry. The medium to longer
finish is a bit oily and has a hint of oak and cherries.
