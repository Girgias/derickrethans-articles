Tonight's dram is an `Auchentoshan American Oak`_. It's from a bottle that I
received as a gift for speaking at `Glasgow PHP`_. Thanks! This Auchentoshan_
does not have an age statement, giving the bottlers a bit more freedom in
which ages of barrels they use to blend with. It is possible that whiskies as
young as three years are part of this "blend". This specific whisky is aged in
first-fill Bourbon casks. Unlike many other whiskies on this calendar, it is
both chill filtered and coloured. 

*Tasting notes*: Over ripe fruits, oak, and a sour grapefruit finish. It's a
little bland, and it has a short finish. It's still quite enjoyable.

*Morag says*: Slightly sharp nose, a little bit like vanilla. Not the
smoothest with a hint of roughness. Short finish. Tastes like cardboard (or
woody). Does not compare well to the `Three Wood`_.

Another dram from Cadenhead's. It is a 21 year old whisky, distilled in 1992.
It is part of their Wine Cask range and as usual, it is non-chill filtered and
no colouring has been added. The `1992 CA`_ is bottled at 55.4% ABV cask
strength. A little curious is that the distillery on the label is `Glen
Moray-Glenlivet`_ — the "Glenlivet" addition is not often seen anymore. There
were only 216, and I'm afraid they are all sold out.

*Tasting notes*: It does need a drop of water to bring out some flavours—at
55.4% it is just a little bit too strong. Hints of sweeter wine, and cake. 
Perhaps a hint of aniseed and a finish of medicinal herbs. I'm not quite sure
what to make of it really.

I recently found the whiskybase_ online, and noticed its extensive list of
available whiskies. However, the whisky I had tonight was not known to them
yet. 

The whisky is a single cask, cask strength whisky bottled by `Speciality
Drinks`_ . This casks rendered 250 bottles and at 54.1% ABV it is a bit on the
stronger side, and needs a little bit of water. I bought it at the `Whisky
Exchange`_ as the bottle of the month[#]_ for July. Interestingly the label on my
bottle is different than what they have on their site.

*Tasting notes*: It is a very clear whisky. I taste hints of apple and cream.
And with more than a hint of toffee. It lingers quite long with a hint of more
toffee.

   about that at some point later.
