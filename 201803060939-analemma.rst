Last week I listened to an episode_ of `The Sceptics' Guide to the Universe`_
where the word of the week was "analemma_". An analemma is a diagram showing
the position of the Sun in the sky over the course of a year, as viewed at a
fixed time of day from the same location on Earth. I once tried to make such a
diagram when I was still living in Norway from a series of photos, but the
weather wasn't consistent enough to make that work.

But as I am currently starting to update the `Guide to Date and Time
Programming`_ for a second edition, I was wondering whether I could create an
analemma from existing PHP functions. Unfortunately, PHP only provides
functionality to calculate when the Sun is at its highest point, through
`date_sun_info()`_::

	<?php
	$sunInfo = date_sun_info(
		(new DateTimeImmutable())->getTimestamp(), // Unix timestamp
		51.53,                                     // latitude
		-0.19                                      // longitude
	);

	$zenith = new DateTimeImmutable( "@{$sunInfo['transit']}" );
	echo $zenith->format( DateTimeImmutable::ISO8601 ), "\n";
	?>

Which on February 26th, was at ``2018-02-26T12:13:38+0000`` in London.

.. _`date_sun_info()`: http://php.net/date_sun_info

Then I remembered that a few years ago I wrote `Where is the Sun?`_. There I
features a new hobby library "astro_" that I was working on. This library
implements a few astronomical calculations. I wrote a little PHP extension
around it too: php-solarsystem_. Neither library or extension have really been
released.

.. _`Where is the Sun?`: /where-is-the-sun.html
.. _astro: https://github.com/derickr/astro
.. _php-solarsystem: https://github.com/derickr/php-solarsystem

The php-solarsystem_ extension implements just one function:
`earth_sunpos()`_, which fortunately does exactly what I needed for drawing an
analemma: it gives you the position of the Sun in the sky for a specific
location on Earth at a specific time.

.. _`earth_sunpos()`: https://github.com/derickr/php-solarsystem/blob/master/solarsystem.c#L14,L22

With this function, all I had to do is calculate the position of the Sun in
the sky at the same time-of-day for a whole year. With the DatePeriod_ class
in PHP, I can easily create an iterator that does just that::

	<?php
	date_default_timezone_set( "UTC" );

	$dateStart = new DateTimeImmutable( "2018-01-01 09:00" );
	$dateEnd   = $dateStart->modify( "+1 year 1 day" );
	$dateInterval = new DateInterval( "P1D" );

	foreach ( new DatePeriod( $dateStart, $dateInterval, $dateEnd ) as $date )
	{
		…
	}
	?>

We don't really want Daylight Saving Time to be in the way, so we set the
time zone to just ``UTC``, which works fine for London for which we'll draw
the analemma.

We start at the start of the year (``2018-01-01 09:00``) and iterate for a
year and a day (``+1 year 1 day``) so we can create a closed loop. Each
iteration increases the returned DateTimeImmutable_ by exactly one day
(``P1D``).

.. _DatePeriod: http://php.net/dateperiod
.. _DateTimeImmutable: http://php.net/datetimeimmutable

After defining the latitude and longitude of London, all we need to do is to
use the `earth_sunpos()`_ function to calculate the azimuth_ and altitude_
inside the loop. Azimuth_ is the direction of where the Sun is, with 180°
being due South. And altitude_ is the height of the Sun above the horizon.

::

	$lat = 51.53;
	$lon = -0.09;

	foreach ( new DatePeriod( $dateStart, $dateInterval, $dateEnd ) as $date )
	{
		$ts = $date->format( 'U' );
		$position = earth_sunpos( $ts, $lat, $lon );
		echo $ts, "\n";
		echo $position['azimuth'], ",";
		echo $position['altitude'], "\n";
	}

.. _azimuth: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Azimuth
.. _altitude: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizontal_coordinate_system

The script outputs the calculation as a "CSV", which we should redirect to a
file::

	php tests/analemma.php > /tmp/analemma.csv

To plot we use the following gnuplot_ script::

	set style line 1 lt 1 lw 2 pt 0 ps 0 linecolor rgb "orange"
	set style line 2 lt 1 lw 1 pt 0 ps 0 linecolor rgb "grey"

	set datafile separator comma
	set xrange [100:150]
	set yrange [0:50]

	set grid linestyle 2
	set terminal png size 640,640 enhanced font "Helvetica,12"
	set output '/tmp/analemma.png'

	plot "/tmp/analemma.csv" using 2:3 title "London @ 9 am" with linespoints linestyle 1

.. _gnuplot: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/gnuplot

With this script, we can then draw the analemma::

	gnuplot /tmp/analemma.plot

The result:
