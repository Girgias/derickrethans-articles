This `Blue Hanger`_ is the only blend on the calendar, but this is an unusual
blend so I am making an exception. This 8th release, is a 21 year old blend.
It is named after William Hanger, the 3rd Lord Coleraine, a loyal customer of
Berry Bros. & Rudd during the late 18th century. He was renowned for the
striking blue clothes he wore and gained the soubriquet, "Blue Hanger".

It is bottled at 45.6% volume, with natural colouring and it is not chill
filtered. It is exclusive to `The Whisky Shop`_. 

*Tasting notes*: Orange peel, vanilla, caramel. With a little bit of salt and
smoke.
