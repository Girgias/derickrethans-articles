This `Blue Hanger`_ is the only blend on the calendar, but this is an unusual
blend so I am making an exception. This 8th release is a 21 year old blend,
bottled by Berry Bros. & Rudd. It is named after William Hanger, the 3rd Lord
Coleraine, a loyal customer of Berry Bros. & Rudd during the late 18th
century. He was renowned for the striking blue clothes he wore and gained the
soubriquet, "Blue Hanger".

It is bottled at 45.6% ABV, with natural colouring and it is not chill
filtered. It is exclusive to `The Whisky Shop`_. 

*Tasting notes*: Orange peel, vanilla, caramel. With a little bit of salt and
smoke.

As this month's whisky of the month, I went to my favourite whisky shop in
London, `Cadenhead's`_. They are best known for their single cask whiskies,
and indeed many of the whiskies on this advent calendar come from them. 

This `Springbank 12 Green`_ whisky is not a single cask whisky. But it
is a very new whisky. So new, that I couldn't find it through Google
yet. The label on the bottle says it's one out of 9000 bottles. It is called
"Green" because it is distilled from organic barley.

It is matured entirely in bourbon casks and bottled at 46% ABV. The result is
creamy and sweet with classic Springbank peatiness giving depth and a hint of
coastal air. 

*Tasting notes*: Very pale. Sweet fruits and a little bit peaty. The whisky
lingers quite long with peat and a hint of sherry.
