The last one! So insisted we had our breakfast at Jack's. It was sortof a
tradition when we started doing the LOOP, but we had got slightly bored of it.
But for the last one, we had to. After that, tubes to Oxford Circus, Mile End
and `Upminster Bridge`_.

The weather was really chilly at around 17Â°C. It got greyer and greyer but we
managed not to get rained upon *until* we got to West Hampstead, nearly home.
Getting home was a bit tricky though, as after a beer quest at St. Pancras the
Thames Link was having some issues.

In any case, we made it! Now what's next?

The photos that I took on this section, as well as the photos of the
other sections of the LOOP_, are available as a `Flickr set`_.
