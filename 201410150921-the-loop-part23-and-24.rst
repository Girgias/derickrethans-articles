The last one! So insisted we had our breakfast at Jack's. It was sort of a
tradition when we started doing the LOOP, but we had got slightly bored of it.
But for the last one, we had to. After that, tubes to Oxford Circus, Mile End
and `Upminster Bridge`_.

Section 23
----------

Just after leaving Upminster Bridge station, we encountered a rather bizarre
situation: an HGV lodged_ in a florist. Apparently it had clipped the bridge,
and then went straight into the building. How rude.

Shortly after, we passed the Windmill pub, but only saw the `Upminster
Windmill`_ in the distance. After crossing a bridge over the Ingrebourne River
we took a right turn to follow the river. Almost for the entire length of this
section. First we encountered some playgrounds, but after a while we made our
way into the Ingrebourne Valley Local Nature Reserve, which connects to the
`Hornchurch Country Park`_. Lots of wetlands, some ponds with birds, and a few
buildings remaining from the second World War, when this was `RAF
Hornchurch`_. It was a fairly pleasant and level walk. One of the stranger
features was the `Ingrebourne Hill Bike Park`_ however, when you can try out
some mountain biking!

At the bottom of the park, we had to cross the busy A1306, but a new
pedestrian crossing made that easier. On the other side we found a big Tesco's
where we acquired some water. Passing a few pubs, with, uhm, not so decent
ratings brought us into Rainham Village, with its `clock tower war
memorial`_ and an old `Norman church`_. A few minutes later we reached
Rainham station, and the end of section 23. Here we also ran into another
group walking the LOOP—and they were also attempting to finish it on the same
day.

Section 24
----------

After passing the other group on the footbridge over `High Speed One`_, and
crossing underneath the busy A13, we soon
came to the Rainham Marshes. We followed a LOOP sign on a path_ through the
Marshes. However, after a few minutes we noticed it wasn't quite following
either the directions off the Walk London website, but also wasn't following
the `mapped route`_ from OpenStreetMap. We back tracked a little and instead
had to go through some industrial area around Ferry Lane. We then also didn't
spot a LOOP sign for quite some time, and the directions were also slightly
misleading too. I have reported the mismatched signing, and I actually hope
they redirect the LOOP through the Marshes instead of around factories and a
land fill!

Taking the mapped route did get us to the Thames quite soon though. Here we
spotted lots of birds as we went past the Tilda rice factory. Just beyond the
factory we stumbled upon a dozen concrete barges, originally part of a
`Mulberry Harbour`_ used in the D-Day landings of the second World War. We
also spotted `The Diver`_, an artwork by John Kaufman.

The rest of the walk around the landfill area was kinda tedious, but easy
going. We were however confused by some fence once getting to the `Rainham
Marshes`_ proper. This reserve, run by the RSPB, is one of the few left over
ancient marshes. They have a nice `visitor's centre`_ on the East side, which
also had a very decent café. After a restorative slice of cake, and crossing a
new footbridge, we had some fun with photographing all the PHP Elephpants. Not
long after, we left the coast and made our way to Rainham station and the end
of our journey around London.

We celebrated with our certificates and a small bottle of procescco. Mission
accomplished!

We took 3½ hours for the last 18km. The weather was really chilly at around
17°C. It got greyer and greyer but we managed not to get rained upon *until*
we got to West Hampstead, nearly home. Getting home was a bit tricky though,
as after a beer quest at St. Pancras the Thames Link was having some issues.

In any case, we made it! What's next?

other sections of the LOOP_, are available as a `Flickr set`_.
