This episode of "PHP Internals News" is the first part of a longer
conversation that I had with Stanislav Malyshev
(`GitHub <https://github.com/smalyshev>`_,
`LinkedIn <http://linkedin.com/in/smalyshev>`_) about security related aspects
of PHP development. In this episode, we discuss a fuzzer to test input safety
of data coming into PHP.
