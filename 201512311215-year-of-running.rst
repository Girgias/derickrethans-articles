It is the last day of the year. Champagne has been acquired, and I am gearing
up to see The Force Awakens tonight. These are the times that we look back on
the past year. From a technical point of view, lots of things happened of
course, such as `PHP 7`_, new PHP and HHVM drivers for MongoDB, and many many
more. But that is not what I want to focus this year's review on. Instead, I
want to talk about running and setting goals.

Go back in time a year. A little more than a year. It is Christmas and the
usual question "Have you made any resolutions for the new year?" pops up
again. Well, for once, that time I had â€” and I don't mean 1024x768. With my
circumference gradually getting larger, I had decided to do something about
it: get fit, and actually mean it. After seeing many of my family-in-law being
addicted to running, picking up "moving my legs really fast" seemed liked a
promising venture for doing something about my level of fitness (level 0,
really).
