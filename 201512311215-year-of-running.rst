It is the last day of the year. Champagne has been acquired, and I am gearing
up to see The Force Awakens tonight. These are the times that we look back on
the past year. From a technical point of view, lots of things happened of
course, such as `PHP 7`_, new PHP and HHVM drivers for MongoDB, and many many
more. But that is not what I want to focus this year's review on. Instead, I
want to talk about running and setting goals.

Go back in time a year. A little more than a year. It is Christmas and the
usual question "Have you made any resolutions for the new year?" pops up
again. Well, for once, that time I had — and I don't mean 1024x768. With my
circumference gradually getting larger, I had decided to do something about
it: get fit, and actually mean it. After seeing many of my family-in-law being
addicted to running, picking up "moving my legs really fast" seemed liked a
promising venture for doing something about my level of fitness (level 0,
really).

I know that starting something is easy, but that finishing something is hard.
I already dabbed with running when I was still living in Norway, but I was
pretty good at coming up with excuses to not go running: "oh, it rains", "oh,
it is cold" (always works in Norway!), "oh, I got out of bed too late". One
thing I did manage to do back in 2007, was actually buying running trainers.

Eight years later, these same running trainers would get me started, but I
also needed a plan. A plan to follow with the uttermost discipline, because
without that I was doomed to fail. The plan came in the form of a 
`Couch to 5K`_ program—also promoted by the NHS_. The NHS makes a handy
podcast available, but I instead opted for using a `C25K app`_ on my
Pebble_. It is very basic, but it does do the trick. Couch to 5K requires you
to do three runs per week. I choose to run on Monday, Wednesday and Friday,
and promised to myself to stick to it. And I did. I do however remember the
first run, not far from home in `Queen's Park`_. The first run consists of 5
minutes of warm up walking, and then alternate 60 seconds of jogging and 90
seconds of walking for a total of 20 minutes. By the third *run for 60
seconds* I thought I was going to die. But I persisted, and completed my first
run. I nearly had to crawl home. But I noticed that with the second and third of
that first week things already started to improve. So I continued with weeks
two, three, and then four, only missing one Friday run because of `PHP
Benelux`_, where I instead ran on a Saturday.

And then came the third run of week five. The dreaded "run for 20 minutes
without any breaks". But I made it. I was so pleased with myself. I finished
the Couch to 5K in 10 weeks, instead of 9 as I went skiing in Norway for a
week. By this time, I had also signed up for RunKeeper_ to track `my
progress`_, and of course, to drool over statistics—I am a geek after all.
During the last few weeks of the Couch to 5K, I set myself another goal: *run
a 10K race in April, and preferrably within an hour*. I signed up for a race
with `The Race Organiser`_ in Hyde Park on April 12th. I have since then done
another race with them, and I think they are good "beginners" races as only
about 500 people show up for them. I was quite ecstatic actually having
finished the race in (just) under an hour!

Since the first "run" on a cold January morning, I have ran 1480km.
I have run several races: A 3.2 mile race in `Central
Park`_ with work as part of the J.P. Morgan Corporate Challenge, the `Vitality
British 10K London Run`_ with 20 000 other runners in Central London, the `Kew
Gardens 10K`_, an awful `Run the River`_ 5K around Tower Bridge and finishing
with a last race in Regent's Park in the middle of December.
I steadily improved my performance up to the point where my 10K Personal
Best is now 49m17s. I also lost 1½ stone, and need new jeans, and the only
thing I have changed this year is the running. I still enjoy beer_,
whisky_, and food.

I definitely got addicted.

But why am I talking to you about running?

It is all about setting goals and following them up with a plan. My first goal
was to get off the couch, and used *Couch to 5K* as my set of milestones. Then
I signed up for a 10K, and worked towards that. Setting a goal, with
measurable milestones is something that does not only apply to running, but
also to career development. Set a goal, figure out a plan how to get there
with mile stones and then work towards them. And practice, lots of practise!

In 2016 I will continue to run, work on Xdebug_ and perhaps also do a new
project for whisky drinkers — stay tuned for that.

As a last note, and I don't know what overcame me, I have signed up for a half
marathon in 50 days with the goal to complete it in under two hours! Wish me
good luck! Perhaps a marathon later in 2016‽

Enjoy the last hours of 2015, and **Happy New Year**!
