Today is the last day of the year. Champagne has been acquired, and I am
gearing up to see The Force Awakens tonight. These are the times that we look
back on the past year. From a technical point of view, lots of things happened
of course, such as `PHP 7`_, new PHP and HHVM drivers for MongoDB, and many
many more. But that is not what I want to focus this year's review on.
Instead, I want to talk about running and setting goals.

Go back in time a year. A little more than a year actually. It is Christmas
and the usual question *Have you made any resolutions for the new year?* pops
up again. Well, for once, I had — and I don't mean 1024x768. With my
circumference gradually getting larger, I had decided to do something about
it: get fitter, and actually mean it. After seeing many of my family-in-law being
addicted to running, picking up *moving my legs really fast* seemed liked a
promising venture for doing something about my level of fitness (level 0,
really).

I know that starting something is easy, but that finishing something is hard.
I already dabbed with running when I was still living in Norway, but I was
pretty good at coming up with excuses to not go running: *oh, it rains*, *oh,
it is cold* (always works in Norway!), or *oh, I got out of bed too late*. One
thing I did manage to do back in 2007, was actually buying running trainers!

Eight years later, I picked up these same running trainers. But I also needed
a plan. A plan to follow to the letter. Without a good plan, I was doomed to
fail. This plan came in the form of a 
`Couch to 5K`_ program—also promoted by the NHS_. The NHS makes a handy
podcast available, but I instead opted for using a `C25K app`_ on my
Pebble_. It is very basic, but it does do the trick. Couch to 5K requires you
to do three runs per week, gradually pushing you from *walk a few minutes* to
*run for 30 minutes*. I choose to run on Monday, Wednesday and Friday,
and promised to myself to stick to it. And I did. I do remember my
first run, not far from home in `Queen's Park`_. The first run consisted of 5
minutes of warm up walking, and then alternate 60 seconds of jogging and 90
seconds of walking for a total of 20 minutes. By the third *run for 60
seconds* I thought I was going to collapse. But I persisted, and completed my
first run. I nearly had to crawl home. But I noticed that with the second and
third workouts of that first week, things already started to improve. So I
continued with weeks two, three, and then four, only missing one Friday run
because of `PHP Benelux`_, where I instead ran on a Saturday. And then came
the third run of week five. The dreaded *run for 20 minutes without any
breaks*. I made it, with shaking legs, but I was so pleased with myself!

I finished the Couch to 5K in 10 weeks, instead of 9 as I went skiing in
Norway for a week. By this time, I had also signed up for RunKeeper_ to track
`my progress`_. Of course also to drool over statistics—I am a geek after all!
With encouragement from my wife, I also signed up for my first real race with
`The Race Organiser`_ in Hyde Park on April 12th. They organise smaller races,
with about 500 people showing up. Excellent for beginning (and experienced)
runners alike. I set myself a goal for completing this race within an hour. I
managed to cross the finish line in 59m13s. Great success!

Since the first run on a cold January morning, I ran 846km and completed
several races: A 3.2 mile race in `Central Park`_ with work as part of the
J.P. Morgan Corporate Challenge, the `Vitality British 10K London Run`_ with
20 000 other runners in Central London, the `Kew Gardens 10K`_, an awful
`Run the River`_ 5K around Tower Bridge, and finishing with a last race in
Regent's Park in the middle of December.
I steadily improved my performance up to the point where my 10K Personal
Best is now 49m17s. 

I definitely got addicted!

I have also lost 1½ stone, and soon might need new jeans. All I have changed
this year is starting to run. I still enjoy beer_, whisky_, and food ☺.

But why am I talking to you about running?

It is all about setting goals and following them up with a plan. My first goal
was to get off the couch, and used *Couch to 5K* as my set of milestones. Then
I signed up for a 10K, and worked towards that. Setting a goal, with
measurable milestones is something that does not only apply to running, but
also to career development. Set a goal, figure out a plan how to get there
with mile stones and then work towards them. And practice, lots of practise!

In 2016, I will continue to run, work on Xdebug_, and perhaps work on a new
project for whisky drinkers — stay tuned for that.

As a last note, and I don't know what overcame me, I have signed up for a half
marathon in 50 days with the goal to complete it in under two hours! Wish me
good luck! Perhaps a marathon later in 2016‽

Enjoy the last hours of 2015, and **Happy New Year**!
