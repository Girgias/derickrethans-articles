Welcome to the first episode of "PHP Internals News", a weekly-ish podcast
about what goes on in the land of PHP development. In this podcast, we discuss
current RFCs that are up for discussion, implementations of features with
technical detail, and explanations of odd bugs, and their fixes.

In this first episode we talk to Nikita Popov about his `Saner string to
number comparisons`_ RFC.
