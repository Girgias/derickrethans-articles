While working on the MongoDB Driver for PHP, we sometimes run into problems
where we send the wrong data to the server, tripping it up, and not getting
the results we want.

Drivers talk to MongoDB with a binary protocol, which we refer to as the `Wire
Protocol`_. It is a documented binary format, mostly wrapping around BSON_
structures.

.. _`Wire Protocol`: https://docs.mongodb.com/master/reference/mongodb-wire-protocol/#messages-types-and-formats
.. _BSON: http://bsonspec.org/

Different versions of the MongoDB may respond with varying message formats and
likewise prefer (or require) that drivers use newer formats to issue commands
and queries. An additional problem is that sometimes mongoS, our query router
for sharding_, wants instructions in different formats, and sends results back
in a slightly different format than mongoD.

.. _sharding: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/sharding/

Over the past years, I have been using a network traffic analyser called
Wireshark_ to figure out what actually gets send over the network connections.

.. _Wireshark: https://www.wireshark.org/

Wireshark runs on various platforms_, and on Debian platforms can easily be
installed by running ``apt install wireshark``. Starting Wireshark presents
you with the following screen:

.. _platforms: https://www.wireshark.org/#download

This screen lists all the network interfaces that are available on the system,
and it allows you to select one (``Loopback: lo`` in my case) and start packet
collection by clicking on the shark fin.

With Wireshark collecting data, I then connected with the MongoDB shell to the
server to see what was sent over a network connection. As no network protocol is the same
as any other, Wireshark contains lots of different "dissectors" to analyse
each specific protocol. There are a *lot* of dissectors, for nearly every
protocol that you can think of—including HTTP, MySQL, NTP, TCP, and of course
MongoDB.

After we connected with the MongoDB shell to the server, we can have a look at
what Wireshark collected.

In this first screenshot we see that the MongoDB client's first packet is a
``Request : Query`` packet. In this first packet it sends an ``isMaster``
command to the server to figure out its version, and some other parameters.
The dissector has unpacked the BSON ``Document`` with length ``201`` to be
able to show us the various elements that make up the request. For example, it
sends along which driver is being used to make the request (``MongoDB Internal
Client``) in the ``client`` → ``driver`` → ``name`` element.

The result includes parameters such as the maximum size of a data packet
(``maxMessageSizeBytes``), the ``localTime``, as well as the `wire version`_
(not pictured). The latter is used to determine which wire protocol versions
can understand.

.. _`wire version`: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/isMaster/#isMaster.minWireVersion

So far we have seen two types of packets, ``Request`` and ``Response``, but
others also exist_. In MongoDB 3.6, two extra types of packages are are
supported. These are the ``Extensible Message Format`` and ``Compressed``
packets. The former is replacing all earlier ways of sending queries and
commands (and receiving their replies), with a new single packet that can be
used in both directions. The latter can be used to compress the data, and this
packet also wraps an ``Extensible Message Format`` packet.

.. _exist: https://docs.mongodb.com/master/reference/mongodb-wire-protocol/#messages-types-and-formats

Unfortunately, Wireshark's MongoDB dissector did not support these new packets
yet. Instead of waiting for them to be added by the maintainers, I set out to
add the missing functionality myself. It is after all closely related to my
day job ☺.

As I had never contributed to Wireshark, I read up on their development
guidelines and quickly found that they have a highly automated way of doing
code reviews with rigorous practises in place. This is a welcome difference
from most other open source projects to which I've contributed.

As I expected, my `first patch`_ adding ``OP_MSG`` support needed a few
revisions before it was merged_.

.. _`first patch`: https://code.wireshark.org/review/#/c/24450/
.. _merged: https://github.com/wireshark/wireshark/commit/641e2fc573b98917916245bfdaf3461ea82c2565

The result of this first patch is that packets of the ``OP_MSG`` type can now
also be visualised:

.. image:: /images/content/wireshark-query-reply.png

A ``Extensible Message Format`` packet consists of one more Sections_, which
can either be a ``Body``, or a ``Document Sequence``. With a ``Body`` being
required with zero or more ``Document Sequence`` sections following. In this
example, all of the ``Message Flags`` are empty (unset).

.. _Sections: https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/mongodb-wire-protocol/#sections

In this case the reply contains a *cursor description*, including its initial
batch (``firstBatch``) of three documents totalling ``6392`` bytes.
Drivers can use these cursor descriptions to iterate over a whole result set. 

Once there is lot of data to transport, it can be beneficial to compress the
data stream. MongoDB 3.4 already included some preliminary work for this, but
with MongoDB 3.6 compression is now enabled by default. It can either use the
snappy_ compressor or zlib_ compressor. Compressed data is send with a
different packet type (OP_COMPRESSED_) which, as you can probably guess,
also was not yet supported.

.. _snappy: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snappy_(compression)
.. _zlib: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zlib
.. _OP_COMPRESSED: https://github.com/mongodb/specifications/blob/master/source/compression/OP_COMPRESSED.rst

My `second patch`_ adds ``OP_COMPRESSED`` support to Wireshark. Adding support
for ``zlib`` was easy, as Wireshark already had helper functions available.
Supporting ``snappy`` required a bit more manual work.

.. _`second patch`: https://github.com/wireshark/wireshark/commit/8225159e336610c25fb4d4129b0be156ed487c49

Compressed packets replace the original packet type (OpCode) with one
(``2012``) to denote it is a compressed packet. The header that describes the
parameters of the compressed data (``Uncompressed Size``, and ``Compressor``)
also includes the original OpCode that is represented in the compressed data
(``Original Opcode``).

When the dissector decompresses a data packet, it adds a new tab containing
the ``Decompressed Data`` so that you can view the raw bytes of this
uncompressed data once you dive into the data structures (e.g. ``Section``,
``BodyDocument``).

With support for OP_MSG and OP_COMPRESSED added, figuring out if we send
something wrong to a MongoDB 3.6 server becomes a lot easier. Things might
still be complicated once we throw SSL into the mix, but that will have to
wait until another blog post.
