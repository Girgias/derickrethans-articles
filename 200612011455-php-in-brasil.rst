My first trip to South America has a busy schedule. Yesterday I flew
from Norway to São Paulo to present at the `PHP Conference Brasil`_ . Tomorrow I will present `Xdebug`_ , and explain how it can help with
debugging PHP applications quicker and easier.

On Monday the 4th I will give a workshop on the `eZ components`_ where attendees will learn on how to use the most important components
that are parts of the `eZ components`_ . There are still places open, so feel free to sign up!
