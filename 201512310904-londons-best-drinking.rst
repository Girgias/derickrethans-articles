For our anniversary, I received a book `The Best 100 London Drinking Places`_.
Of course, both of us liking beer and the occasional cocktail now have set out
to try out all of them. Some of the places in the book we had already visited,
but they are all places to return to, so they are featured in this series of
articles as well

The first pub we visited was the `Queen's Head`_ in `King's Cross`_.
