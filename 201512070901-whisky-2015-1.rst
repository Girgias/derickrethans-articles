December 1st: Bunnahabhain 12
-----------------------------

*Tasting notes*: Caramel and salt, with peaty undertones and a little herbal.

*About Bunnahabhain:* One of our favourite drams, well, the 18 year old that
is. The 12 year old is also very drinkable. Sadly, we did not manage to visit
the `Bunnahabhain distillery`_ on our `whisky tour`_ to Islay last year.

Amazon sells it for `£35 on amazon.co.uk`__.

December 2st: Bunnahabhain 18
-----------------------------

*Tasting notes*: Caramel and sherry, oily and dense. Perhaps a little salt and
nutty too

*About Bunnahabhain:* The bigger brother of yesterday's 12 year old. It's
quite a bit nicer, but also quite a bit pricier :-)

Amazon sells it for `£35 on amazon.co.uk`__.

December 3rd: House of Lords whisky
-----------------------------------

*Tasting notes*: Apple toffee - very mellow, and easy to drink. I guess that's
why the Lords don't get a lot of stuff done.

*About the House of Lords whisky:* This Speyside Single Malt whisky is aged
for 10 years. It's specially selected for the House of Lords, this Single
Malt has been aged in oak sherry casks in Scotland for a minimum of ten
years. It has been distilled following the age old tradition of the Scottish
Highlands, from the finest selection of malted barley.
