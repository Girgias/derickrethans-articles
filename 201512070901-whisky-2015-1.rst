December 1st: Bunnahabhain 12
-----------------------------

*Tasting notes*: Caramel and salt, with peaty undertones and a little herbal.

*About Bunnahabhain:* One of our favourite drams, well, the 18 year old that
is. The 12 year old is also very drinkable. Sadly, we did not manage to visit
the `Bunnahabhain distillery`_ on our `whisky tour`_ to Islay last year.

Amazon sells it for `£35 on amazon.co.uk`__.

December 2st: Bunnahabhain 18
-----------------------------

*Tasting notes*: Caramel and sherry, oily and dense. Perhaps a little salt and
nutty too

*About Bunnahabhain:* The bigger brother of yesterday's 12 year old. It's
quite a bit nicer, but also quite a bit pricier :-)

Amazon sells it for `£80 on amazon.co.uk`__.

December 3rd: House of Lords whisky
-----------------------------------

*Tasting notes*: Apple toffee - very mellow, and easy to drink. I guess that's
why the Lords don't get a lot of stuff done.

*About the House of Lords whisky:* This `Speyside Single Malt whisky`_ is aged
for 10 years. It's specially selected for the House of Lords, this Single
Malt has been aged in oak sherry casks in Scotland for a minimum of ten
years. It has been distilled following the age old tradition of the Scottish
Highlands, from the finest selection of malted barley.

December 4th: Old Malt Cask: Single Cask 21 year old Strathmill
---------------------------------------------------------------

*Tasting notes*: Sweet vanilla custard with caramel, with a hint of pepper at
the end.

*About the whisky*: It got given to me by an anonymous benefactor—allegedly
because of my work on Xdebug_. It's single cask and one of only 294 bottles at
50% ABV. The Strathmill_ distillery itself is in the heart of Speyside and is
currently owned by Diageo_. They mostly use the whisky that this distillery
produces in blended malts such as J&B whisky. Luckily, this one has escaped
this horrendous outcome and stayed a nice single cask whisky for us to enjoy.

December 5th: Octomore 6.3
--------------------------

*Tasting notes*: Honey, peat, and some herbal tones, and alcohol. It lingers
very long.

*About the whisky*: The `Octomore 06.3`_ is a 5 year aged whisky, made from
single field of barley from Islay—and hence, party of their "Islay Barley"
series. It is one of the heaviest peated whiskies with a phenol_ count of 258
ppm_, and it's cask strength at 64% too. Although it is so heavily peated, and
it is most definitely there while tasting it, it is not overreaching and
drowning out everything else, which I sometimes find with some of the much
less peated Islay whiskies. We bought this bottle on our first anniversary at
`Milroy's`_ after having gotten a free tasting at their bar after dinner. It
does not come cheap at about £150.

December 6th: Single cask Glengoyne 14, bottled by Cadenhead's
--------------------------------------------------------------

*Tasting notes*: Peppery and very big. It's a bit chewy with hints of Sherry
and toffee.

*About the whisky*: This__ is one of `Cadenhead's`_ `small batch`_ bottlings. As
one of 840 bottles, it is not a single cask whisky. It was distilled in 2001
and at 14 years old, bottled at 46% ABV.

December 7th: Hakushu 12
------------------------

*Tasting notes*: Light fruity whisky with some grass and ginger hints. A bit
buttery on the palette.

*About the whisky*: A single malt whisky__ by Suntory. The Japanese distillery
of Hakushu set in a forest, and often touted to be the source of the grassy
notes of the whiskies.
