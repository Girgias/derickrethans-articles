Two years ago Morag and I went on a whisky tasting tour with `Rabbie's`_ to
visit a few of `Speyside's distilleries`_. Now, this August we left the smooth
and sweeter whiskies a side, and instead we headed over to Islay. Again with
`Rabbie's`_.

Day 0: Edinburgh
----------------

Our train up to Edinburgh was nothing special, except that Eastcoast has now
been replaced with `Virgin Trains East Coast`_. No real changes, except for
the name. This time however, we got into Edinburgh just as the Fringe_ was
starting. And that made *staying* in Edinburgh quite a bit more expensive. We
thought to be clever and book a hotel near Rabbie's pick-up point, but I had
failed to realize that they actually moved it—right next to the hotel we
stayed in last time.

The afternoon before the tour started, we had some free time in Edinburgh. We
promptly headed to `BrewDog's`_ pub to have a beer and play some
connect-four, before we headed to `The Edinburgh Larder`_ for a nice meal. On
the way back, we caught the last Sun rays hitting `Edinburgh Castle`_.

Day 1: From Edinburgh to Islay
------------------------------

The next morning we got up quite early, had some breakfast at the hotel and
headed towards our pick up point at Rabbie's Cafe. With a tour like this,
it is always a bit of a guess on what sort of group you get. This time, we
were touring with two Swiss, two Slovenians, three Indians, three Canadians
and a very loud Australian. On the way to Islay we also picked up two
Japanese in Glasgow. On the last tour, we had a few people that didn't like
whisky, but this time one of the Canadians was actually **allergic** to whisky
(and beer).

It is quite a trip to Islay, but luckily we stopped at many places on the way
there. The first stop was at Luss_, in the `Loch Lomond and The Trossachs
National Park`_. From there on, we travelled to Islay with a stop at `The Rest
and Be Thankful`_  on the A83_. The slightly funny name comes from the time
where you had armies going down the Glen and having to climb up to the pass.
They could only rest when they got to the top - and clearly they were thankful
for that!

For lunch we stopped at the `Royal Burgh Cafe`_ in Inveraray_. I had to try
one of my favourite Scottish dishes, `Cullen Skink`_, a thick soup made of
smoked haddock, potatoes and onions. Inveraray itself is a small town on the
coast of `Loch Fyne`_. It has a pretty nice castle for which we didn't have
time, and apparently an old jail that you can visit.

After lunch we drove for a fair bit and stopped for a quick wee pint in
Kilmartin_ at the `Kilmartin Hotel`_ across from the parish church, before
having a good look at a set of standing stones. After another short drive, we
took some time to walk up Dunadd_, a hillfort and suspected capital of the
ancient kingdom of `Dál Riata`_.

We made one last stop to stretch our legs at Tarbert_ on our way to the
`Kennacraig Ferry Terminal`_ from where we took our ferry to Islay. After
about half an hour's drive we finally arrived at our accommodation in one of
`Bowmore distillery's cottages`_. On the dining table was a bottle of `Bowmore
12`_ waiting for us! We ignored the bottle and headed straight to the
`Lochside hotel`_ to taste different whiskies instead. We sampled:

 - `Tullibardine 228`_: Hints of dark red wine. But too young and sharp. *66*
 - `Tullibardine 500`_: Sweet smell. Toffee/fudge, and sweet woody sherry
   notes. *72*
 - Amrut_: Young and unrefined. Marzipan, vanilla, nutty. *70*
 - Kavalan_: Light fresh grassy sweetness. Perhaps some tropical notes and
   some vanilla. *73*
 - Royal Lochnagar Muscat Finish: A little watery. Very light fresh
   berries with nuts. And of course a muscat finish. *78*
 - `Bunnahabhain 25`_: Very complex peaty whisky. Rich berries, but I think I
   like the `Bunnahabhain 18`_ better. Not worth £220 a bottle! *82*
