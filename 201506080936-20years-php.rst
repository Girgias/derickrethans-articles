I know I am a day late, but PHP turned 20 yesterday! Congrats!

`Ben Ramsey`_ wrote about his 20 years of PHP yesterday, and invited others to
do the same. So here I go.

Back in 1999 during uni, a few friends and I got annoyed by Schumacher's
antics, and started the "Anti Schumacher Club". In order to have a membership
part of our site (which thankfully can no longer be found on the Internet), we
used PHP. Oh yeah, we also used it to scrape websites to find e-mail
addresses to send our propaganda to.

My first patch to PHP was in June 2000 when I added__ support for Flash
objects to `getimagesize()`_. After an idiotic idea to `implement MySQL
subselects`_ in PHP itself, I continued with my PHP career by starting to
maintain the mcrypt_ extension later in 2000. It needed support for a new API
version. Both `getimagesize()`_ and mcrypt support is something that I needed
while working at the company that I started with the same guys as the Anti
Schumacher Club. Throughout 2000 and later, I started to contribute little
bits and bobs to PHP. These included committing Ilia's `first extension`_,
adding `the 'u' modifier to printf/sprintf which prints unsigned longs`_, etc.

In April 2002, I started working on Xdebug_. First by adding the
`max_nesting_level`_ feature and functions to provide memory usage, and then
later of course by adding stack traces and support for the remote debugging.
First by mimicking the PHP 3 handler, and then later by adding a GDB like
debug handler, and DBGp_. The PHP 3 and GDB handlers are of course long gone,
but the DBGp_ protocol is still being used by IDEs to interact with Xdebug.
Ilia implemented a basic profiler as well during 2002. I also "release
mastered" PHP 4.1.1 and various 4.2 releases during this time.

The DBGP_ protocol is something that I developed together with the guys from
ActiveState_ in late 2003. Their Komodo_ editor still implements DBGp in the
most comprehensive way, although other IDEs seem to be much more popular now.
The same protocol I implemented for `Maguma Workbench`_ and during my time
there `eZ Systems`_ approached me to come and work for them. I had previously
spoken at their `summer camp`_, which provided a nice introduction to start a
5+ year employment relationship.

I started speaking a while earlier though, mostly on Xdebug_, but also on SRM
— a sort of app server for PHP. That never really got off the ground though,
as it doesn't really fit the shared-nothing architecture of PHP. Since these
first few speaking engagements, I now have given 326 at 201 conferences/user
group meet-ups in 92 different locations. 

After eZ Systems, and due to my work on Xdebug_ I decided to work for myself
for a while. I started `writing PHP extensions`_ as a job, and due to that, I
ended up contributing a little to the MongoDB_ driver_. And that turned later
into being an employee of MongoDB, where I now work on both the PHP and HHVM_
drivers.

Without PHP, none of this would have happened. I would also not have moved to
London, as it's due to Johanna's persistence — I met her at php[tek] in
Chicago — to give up the boringness of Norway and move into the "PHP House" in
London. With her, Helgi, Arpad, and on the weekends Scott, we wrote a lot of
code, and  as well. I wouldn't
have met my wife, met countless friends at various conferences and online, and
I would certainly not have had a few dozen colourful pachyderms in my house!
And it all started with Michael Schumacher, and some Danish guy that wrote
some counters for his website.

Here is to another twenty years!
