The last seven years, I have worked with, and for MongoDB_. I have seen it grow
from a small start-up, then called 10Gen, with fewer than a hundred people,
into a NASDAQ listed_ company with over a thousand employees. But now, after
all these years, it's time for me to move on.

I've learned a lot, and I have worked with very good people. In these seven
years I rewrote the PHP driver (twice), wrote an HHVM driver (remember HHVM?),
and implemented `time zone support`_ in the MongoDB server. I will be leaving
the `PHP driver for MongoDB`_ in `Jeremy's`_ and other colleagues' capable
hands. 

I have come to greatly admire both the engineers at MongoDB, as well as the
technology that we all created. I am a big fan of MongoDB, and will continue
to speak and write about it.

What's next for me? That I'll explain in my next post.
