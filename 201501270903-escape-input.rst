At last weekend's `PHP Benelux`_ I gave a tutorial_ titled "From SQL to NoSQL".
Large parts of that where on using MongoDBâ€”how to use it from PHP, schema
design, etc. I ran a little short of time, so since then I've been getting
some questions. One of them being, "Should I Escape My Input, And If So,
How?". Instead of trying to cram my answer in 140 characters on Twitter, I
thought it'd be wise to reply with this blog post.
